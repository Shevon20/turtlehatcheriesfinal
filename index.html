      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hatcheries can be utilized as a technique for ex situ conservation, although it's highly debatable whether or not they help with effective management 
        of sea turtle populations. The seven hatcheries that are now operating in Sri Lanka were evaluated using a questionnaire survey. Private owners ran every 
        hatchery, and earning money from ecotourism was their main goal. Hatcheries just started operating all year round, as opposed to the 1990s when they were
         only open during the tourist season. It was standard procedure to purchase sea turtle eggs from egg collectors for an average price of 8 to 15 LKR
          (approximately 0.15 USD) per and bury them inside a hatchery's incubation enclosure.
          At all hatcheries, "headstarting" took place. Despite being frequently cleaned, the majority of the rearing tanks were packed during the turtle breeding 
          season. When feeding grew too expensive, young and sub-adult turtles that had been maintained for exhibition were frequently released into the ocean.
           None of the hatcheries participated in any joint research projects or offered visitor programs that aided in sea turtle conservation; rather, their 
           operations served as tourist attractions and sources of cash for the community.

    <h2>About Turtle Hatcheries</h2>
    <p>In many nations (Shanker, 1994; Upm & Perhilitan, 1996; Chan, 2001; Shanker, 2003), including the southeast coast of Sri Lanka 
      (Hewavisenthi, 1993; Tisdell and Wilson, 2005a), sea turtle hatcheries are used as an ex situ conservation technique. Sea turtle hatcheries have been 
       credited as helping to conserve sea turtle populations, however questions have been raised concerning their effectiveness 
      (Hewavisenthi, 1993; Shanker & Pilcher, 2003). By fusing economic and ecological characteristics, Tisdell and Wilson (2005a) analyzed the function of 
      tourism-based sea turtle hatcheries and showed that, while hatcheries can contribute to sea turtle conservation, their efficacy depends on management.
      The five sea turtle species that nest in Sri Lanka are the green (Chelonia mydas), leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), loggerhead (Caretta caretta), 
      hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), and olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) (Deraniyagala, 1953). Although nesting takes place all year round, 
      the nesting season is thought to last from March to May, peaking in April (Ekanayake et al., 2002; 2010). Important breeding and foraging sites can be 
      found around the south and southeast coasts, which include appropriate beaches, sizable seagrass beds, and coral reefs (Deraniyagala, 1939; Amarasooriya, 
      2000). Tourism is heavily focused along these shores and there is a considerable human population in this area.
      According to a 2007 survey, several villagers from the turtle nesting sites had eaten turtle eggs, however the majority of these incidents took place in 
      the 1990s or earlier (Rajakaruna et al., 2009).

      The Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka, a non-governmental organization for nature preservation, created the first sea turtle hatchery in 
      Sri Lanka in 1956 near Yala National Park. at 1969, a second hatchery opened its doors at Palatupana. 
      The main goals of both hatcheries' opening were to conserve, restore, and manage sea turtles and their ecosystems in Sri Lanka. As many as 23 new hatcheries 
      opened throughout the 1970s, which saw a sharp rise in the number of hatcheries (Fernando, 1977). Since then, the number of hatcheries has changed. In 1994, 
      16 were counted (Richardson, 1995), and in 1996, 25 were listed in the proposed action plan for conservation, restoration, and management of turtles and 
      their habitats in Sri Lanka (de Silva, 1996). Only seven hatcheries were found in a 1996 survey, nevertheless (Amarasooriya & Dayaratne, 1997). 
      Three hatcheries reportedly used 48,934 turtle eggs in 1981 and 1982, according to Wickremasinghe (1982); the IUCN (2005) calculated that nine hatcheries
       utilized roughly 300,000 turtle eggs in 2000.
       Only two of the hatcheries that were in operation in the 1990s declared conservation to be their primary goal; the others operated exclusively for
        financial benefit (IUCN, 2005). Since hatcheries rarely kept track of hatching success or tracked hatchlings once they reached the shore, the long-term 
        success of these initiatives cannot be assessed (Hewavisenthi, 1993; Hewavisenthi & Kotagama, 1990). The Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) in 
        Sri Lanka believed that the management practices used at the majority of hatcheries were not helpful for sea turtle conservation, despite the fact that 
        the contribution of turtle hatcheries to sea turtle conservation was hotly contested (IUCN, 2005). We carried out a survey to evaluate the operations of 
        the Sri Lankan hatcheries currently in operation as well as their prospective impact on sea turtle conservation.
